    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! I’m a 20-year-old aspiring full-stack web developer with a passion for coding, gaming, and continuous self-improvement. I’m currently focused on building my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by working on real projects and learning something new every day.</p>
    <p>I enjoy solving problems, creating clean user interfaces, and collaborating with others to bring ideas to life. With a background in customer support, I’ve developed strong communication skills and a team-first mindset. I’m always open to new ideas and conversations—whether it’s about tech, design, or just finding the best gaming setup!</p>
    <p>I’m excited to grow in the tech industry and contribute to building useful, user-friendly digital experiences.</p>
